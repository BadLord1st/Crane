This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Context Gathering Protocol

Design skills produce generic output without project context. You MUST have confirmed design context before doing any design work.

**Required context** — every design skill needs at minimum:
- **Target audience**: Who uses this product and in what context?
- **Use cases**: What jobs are they trying to get done?
- **Brand personality/tone**: How should the interface feel?

Individual skills may require additional context — check the skill's preparation section for specifics.

**CRITICAL**: You cannot infer this context by reading the codebase. Code tells you what was built, not who it's for or what it should feel like. Only the creator can provide this context.

**Gathering order:**
1. **Check current instructions (instant)**: If your loaded instructions already contain a **Design Context** section, proceed immediately.
2. **Check .impeccable.md (fast)**: If not in instructions, read `.impeccable.md` from the project root. If it exists and contains the required context, proceed.
3. **Run teach-impeccable (REQUIRED)**: If neither source has context, you MUST run /teach-impeccable NOW before doing anything else. Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT attempt to infer context from the codebase instead.

## Design Direction

Commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography
→ *Consult the **typography reference** section below for scales, pairing, and loading strategies.*

Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.

**DO**: Use a modular type scale with fluid sizing (clamp)
**DO**: Vary font weights and sizes to create clear visual hierarchy
**DON'T**: Use overused fonts—Inter, Roboto, Arial, Open Sans, system defaults
**DON'T**: Use monospace typography as lazy shorthand for "technical/developer" vibes
**DON'T**: Put large icons with rounded corners above every heading—they rarely add value and make sites look templated

### Color & Theme
→ *Consult the **color reference** section below for OKLCH, palettes, and dark mode.*

Commit to a cohesive palette. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.

**DO**: Use modern CSS color functions (oklch, color-mix, light-dark) for perceptually uniform, maintainable palettes
**DO**: Tint your neutrals toward your brand hue—even a subtle hint creates subconscious cohesion
**DON'T**: Use gray text on colored backgrounds—it looks washed out; use a shade of the background color instead
**DON'T**: Use pure black (#000) or pure white (#fff)—always tint; pure black/white never appears in nature
**DON'T**: Use the AI color palette: cyan-on-dark, purple-to-blue gradients, neon accents on dark backgrounds
**DON'T**: Use gradient text for "impact"—especially on metrics or headings; it's decorative rather than meaningful
**DON'T**: Default to dark mode with glowing accents—it looks "cool" without requiring actual design decisions

### Layout & Space
→ *Consult the **spatial reference** section below for grids, rhythm, and container queries.*

Create visual rhythm through varied spacing—not the same padding everywhere. Embrace asymmetry and unexpected compositions. Break the grid intentionally for emphasis.

**DO**: Create visual rhythm through varied spacing—tight groupings, generous separations
**DO**: Use fluid spacing with clamp() that breathes on larger screens
**DO**: Use asymmetry and unexpected compositions; break the grid intentionally for emphasis
**DON'T**: Wrap everything in cards—not everything needs a container
**DON'T**: Nest cards inside cards—visual noise, flatten the hierarchy
**DON'T**: Use identical card grids—same-sized cards with icon + heading + text, repeated endlessly
**DON'T**: Use the hero metric layout template—big number, small label, supporting stats, gradient accent
**DON'T**: Center everything—left-aligned text with asymmetric layouts feels more designed
**DON'T**: Use the same spacing everywhere—without rhythm, layouts feel monotonous

### Visual Details
**DO**: Use intentional, purposeful decorative elements that reinforce brand
**DON'T**: Use glassmorphism everywhere—blur effects, glass cards, glow borders used decoratively rather than purposefully
**DON'T**: Use rounded elements with thick colored border on one side—a lazy accent that almost never looks intentional
**DON'T**: Use sparklines as decoration—tiny charts that look sophisticated but convey nothing meaningful
**DON'T**: Use rounded rectangles with generic drop shadows—safe, forgettable, could be any AI output
**DON'T**: Use modals unless there's truly no better alternative—modals are lazy

### Motion
→ *Consult the **motion reference** section below for timing, easing, and reduced motion.*

Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.

**DO**: Use motion to convey state changes—entrances, exits, feedback
**DO**: Use exponential easing (ease-out-quart/quint/expo) for natural deceleration
**DO**: For height animations, use grid-template-rows transitions instead of animating height directly
**DON'T**: Animate layout properties (width, height, padding, margin)—use transform and opacity only
**DON'T**: Use bounce or elastic easing—they feel dated and tacky; real objects decelerate smoothly

### Interaction
→ *Consult the **interaction reference** section below for forms, focus, and loading patterns.*

Make interactions feel fast. Use optimistic UI—update immediately, sync later.

**DO**: Use progressive disclosure—start simple, reveal sophistication through interaction (basic options first, advanced behind expandable sections; hover states that reveal secondary actions)
**DO**: Design empty states that teach the interface, not just say "nothing here"
**DO**: Make every interactive surface feel intentional and responsive
**DON'T**: Repeat the same information—redundant headers, intros that restate the heading
**DON'T**: Make every button primary—use ghost buttons, text links, secondary styles; hierarchy matters

### Responsive
→ *Consult the **responsive reference** section below for mobile-first, fluid design, and container queries.*

**DO**: Use container queries (@container) for component-level responsiveness
**DO**: Adapt the interface for different contexts—don't just shrink it
**DON'T**: Hide critical functionality on mobile—adapt the interface, don't amputate it

### UX Writing
→ *Consult the **ux-writing reference** section below for labels, errors, and empty states.*

**DO**: Make every word earn its place
**DON'T**: Repeat information users can already see

---

## The AI Slop Test

**Critical quality check**: If you showed this interface to someone and said "AI made this," would they believe you immediately? If yes, that's the problem.

A distinctive interface should make someone ask "how was this made?" not "which AI made this?"

Review the DON'T guidelines above—they are the fingerprints of AI-generated work from 2024-2025.

---

## Implementation Principles

Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices across generations.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back—show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.

# Color & Contrast

## Color Spaces: Use OKLCH

**Stop using HSL.** Use OKLCH (or LCH) instead. It's perceptually uniform, meaning equal steps in lightness *look* equal—unlike HSL where 50% lightness in yellow looks bright while 50% in blue looks dark.

```css
/* OKLCH: lightness (0-100%), chroma (0-0.4+), hue (0-360) */
--color-primary: oklch(60% 0.15 250);      /* Blue */
--color-primary-light: oklch(85% 0.08 250); /* Same hue, lighter */
--color-primary-dark: oklch(35% 0.12 250);  /* Same hue, darker */
```

**Key insight**: As you move toward white or black, reduce chroma (saturation). High chroma at extreme lightness looks garish. A light blue at 85% lightness needs ~0.08 chroma, not the 0.15 of your base color.

## Building Functional Palettes

### The Tinted Neutral Trap

**Pure gray is dead.** Add a subtle hint of your brand hue to all neutrals:

```css
/* Dead grays */
--gray-100: oklch(95% 0 0);     /* No personality */
--gray-900: oklch(15% 0 0);

/* Warm-tinted grays (add brand warmth) */
--gray-100: oklch(95% 0.01 60);  /* Hint of warmth */
--gray-900: oklch(15% 0.01 60);

/* Cool-tinted grays (tech, professional) */
--gray-100: oklch(95% 0.01 250); /* Hint of blue */
--gray-900: oklch(15% 0.01 250);
```

The chroma is tiny (0.01) but perceptible. It creates subconscious cohesion between your brand color and your UI.

### Palette Structure

A complete system needs:

| Role | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Primary** | Brand, CTAs, key actions | 1 color, 3-5 shades |
| **Neutral** | Text, backgrounds, borders | 9-11 shade scale |
| **Semantic** | Success, error, warning, info | 4 colors, 2-3 shades each |
| **Surface** | Cards, modals, overlays | 2-3 elevation levels |

**Skip secondary/tertiary unless you need them.** Most apps work fine with one accent color. Adding more creates decision fatigue and visual noise.

### The 60-30-10 Rule (Applied Correctly)

This rule is about **visual weight**, not pixel count:

- **60%**: Neutral backgrounds, white space, base surfaces
- **30%**: Secondary colors—text, borders, inactive states
- **10%**: Accent—CTAs, highlights, focus states

The common mistake: using the accent color everywhere because it's "the brand color." Accent colors work *because* they're rare. Overuse kills their power.

## Contrast & Accessibility

### WCAG Requirements

| Content Type | AA Minimum | AAA Target |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Body text | 4.5:1 | 7:1 |
| Large text (18px+ or 14px bold) | 3:1 | 4.5:1 |
| UI components, icons | 3:1 | 4.5:1 |
| Non-essential decorations | None | None |

**The gotcha**: Placeholder text still needs 4.5:1. That light gray placeholder you see everywhere? Usually fails WCAG.

### Dangerous Color Combinations

These commonly fail contrast or cause readability issues:

- Light gray text on white (the #1 accessibility fail)
- **Gray text on any colored background**—gray looks washed out and dead on color. Use a darker shade of the background color, or transparency
- Red text on green background (or vice versa)—8% of men can't distinguish these
- Blue text on red background (vibrates visually)
- Yellow text on white (almost always fails)
- Thin light text on images (unpredictable contrast)

### Never Use Pure Gray or Pure Black

Pure gray (`oklch(50% 0 0)`) and pure black (`#000`) don't exist in nature—real shadows and surfaces always have a color cast. Even a chroma of 0.005-0.01 is enough to feel natural without being obviously tinted. (See tinted neutrals example above.)

### Testing

Don't trust your eyes. Use tools:

- [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- Browser DevTools → Rendering → Emulate vision deficiencies
- [Polypane](https://polypane.app/) for real-time testing

## Theming: Light & Dark Mode

### Dark Mode Is Not Inverted Light Mode

You can't just swap colors. Dark mode requires different design decisions:

| Light Mode | Dark Mode |
|------------|-----------|
| Shadows for depth | Lighter surfaces for depth (no shadows) |
| Dark text on light | Light text on dark (reduce font weight) |
| Vibrant accents | Desaturate accents slightly |
| White backgrounds | Never pure black—use dark gray (oklch 12-18%) |

```css
/* Dark mode depth via surface color, not shadow */
:root[data-theme="dark"] {
  --surface-1: oklch(15% 0.01 250);
  --surface-2: oklch(20% 0.01 250);  /* "Higher" = lighter */
  --surface-3: oklch(25% 0.01 250);

  /* Reduce text weight slightly */
  --body-weight: 350;  /* Instead of 400 */
}
```

### Token Hierarchy

Use two layers: primitive tokens (`--blue-500`) and semantic tokens (`--color-primary: var(--blue-500)`). For dark mode, only redefine the semantic layer—primitives stay the same.

## Alpha Is A Design Smell

Heavy use of transparency (rgba, hsla) usually means an incomplete palette. Alpha creates unpredictable contrast, performance overhead, and inconsistency. Define explicit overlay colors for each context instead. Exception: focus rings and interactive states where see-through is needed.

---

**Avoid**: Relying on color alone to convey information. Creating palettes without clear roles for each color. Using pure black (#000) for large areas. Skipping color blindness testing (8% of men affected).

---

# Interaction Design

## The Eight Interactive States

Every interactive element needs these states designed:

| State | When | Visual Treatment |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **Default** | At rest | Base styling |
| **Hover** | Pointer over (not touch) | Subtle lift, color shift |
| **Focus** | Keyboard/programmatic focus | Visible ring (see below) |
| **Active** | Being pressed | Pressed in, darker |
| **Disabled** | Not interactive | Reduced opacity, no pointer |
| **Loading** | Processing | Spinner, skeleton |
| **Error** | Invalid state | Red border, icon, message |
| **Success** | Completed | Green check, confirmation |

**The common miss**: Designing hover without focus, or vice versa. They're different. Keyboard users never see hover states.

## Focus Rings: Do Them Right

**Never `outline: none` without replacement.** It's an accessibility violation. Instead, use `:focus-visible` to show focus only for keyboard users:

```css
/* Hide focus ring for mouse/touch */
button:focus {
  outline: none;
}

/* Show focus ring for keyboard */
button:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid var(--color-accent);
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

**Focus ring design**:
- High contrast (3:1 minimum against adjacent colors)
- 2-3px thick
- Offset from element (not inside it)
- Consistent across all interactive elements

## Form Design: The Non-Obvious

**Placeholders aren't labels**—they disappear on input. Always use visible `<label>` elements. **Validate on blur**, not on every keystroke (exception: password strength). Place errors **below** fields with `aria-describedby` connecting them.

## Loading States

**Optimistic updates**: Show success immediately, rollback on failure. Use for low-stakes actions (likes, follows), not payments or destructive actions. **Skeleton screens > spinners**—they preview content shape and feel faster than generic spinners.

## Modals: The Inert Approach

Focus trapping in modals used to require complex JavaScript. Now use the `inert` attribute:

```html
<!-- When modal is open -->
<main inert>
  <!-- Content behind modal can't be focused or clicked -->
</main>
<dialog open>
  <h2>Modal Title</h2>
  <!-- Focus stays inside modal -->
</dialog>
```

Or use the native `<dialog>` element:

```javascript
const dialog = document.querySelector('dialog');
dialog.showModal();  // Opens with focus trap, closes on Escape
```

## The Popover API

For tooltips, dropdowns, and non-modal overlays, use native popovers:

```html
<button popovertarget="menu">Open menu</button>
<div id="menu" popover>
  <button>Option 1</button>
  <button>Option 2</button>
</div>
```

**Benefits**: Light-dismiss (click outside closes), proper stacking, no z-index wars, accessible by default.

## Dropdown & Overlay Positioning

Dropdowns rendered with `position: absolute` inside a container that has `overflow: hidden` or `overflow: auto` will be clipped. This is the single most common dropdown bug in generated code.

### CSS Anchor Positioning

The modern solution uses the CSS Anchor Positioning API to tether an overlay to its trigger without JavaScript:

```css
.trigger {
  anchor-name: --menu-trigger;
}

.dropdown {
  position: fixed;
  position-anchor: --menu-trigger;
  position-area: block-end span-inline-end;
  margin-top: 4px;
}

/* Flip above if no room below */
@position-try --flip-above {
  position-area: block-start span-inline-end;
  margin-bottom: 4px;
}
```

Because the dropdown uses `position: fixed`, it escapes any `overflow` clipping on ancestor elements. The `@position-try` block handles viewport edges automatically. **Browser support**: Chrome 125+, Edge 125+. Not yet in Firefox or Safari - use a fallback for those browsers.

### Popover + Anchor Combo

Combining the Popover API with anchor positioning gives you stacking, light-dismiss, accessibility, and correct positioning in one pattern:

```html
<button popovertarget="menu" class="trigger">Open</button>
<div id="menu" popover class="dropdown">
  <button>Option 1</button>
  <button>Option 2</button>
</div>
```

The `popover` attribute places the element in the **top layer**, which sits above all other content regardless of z-index or overflow. No portal needed.

### Portal / Teleport Pattern

In component frameworks, render the dropdown at the document root and position it with JavaScript:

- **React**: `createPortal(dropdown, document.body)`
- **Vue**: `<Teleport to="body">`
- **Svelte**: Use a portal library or mount to `document.body`

Calculate position from the trigger's `getBoundingClientRect()`, then apply `position: fixed` with `top` and `left` values. Recalculate on scroll and resize.

### Fixed Positioning Fallback

For browsers without anchor positioning support, `position: fixed` with manual coordinates avoids overflow clipping:

```css
.dropdown {
  position: fixed;
  /* top/left set via JS from trigger's getBoundingClientRect() */
}
```

Check viewport boundaries before rendering. If the dropdown would overflow the bottom edge, flip it above the trigger. If it would overflow the right edge, align it to the trigger's right side instead.

### Anti-Patterns

- **`position: absolute` inside `overflow: hidden`** - The dropdown will be clipped. Use `position: fixed` or the top layer instead.
- **Arbitrary z-index values** like `z-index: 9999` - Use a semantic z-index scale: `dropdown (100) -> sticky (200) -> modal-backdrop (300) -> modal (400) -> toast (500) -> tooltip (600)`.
- **Rendering dropdown markup inline** without an escape hatch from the parent's stacking context. Either use `popover` (top layer), a portal, or `position: fixed`.

## Destructive Actions: Undo > Confirm

**Undo is better than confirmation dialogs**—users click through confirmations mindlessly. Remove from UI immediately, show undo toast, actually delete after toast expires. Use confirmation only for truly irreversible actions (account deletion), high-cost actions, or batch operations.

## Keyboard Navigation Patterns

### Roving Tabindex

For component groups (tabs, menu items, radio groups), one item is tabbable; arrow keys move within:

```html
<div role="tablist">
  <button role="tab" tabindex="0">Tab 1</button>
  <button role="tab" tabindex="-1">Tab 2</button>
  <button role="tab" tabindex="-1">Tab 3</button>
</div>
```

Arrow keys move `tabindex="0"` between items. Tab moves to the next component entirely.

### Skip Links

Provide skip links (`<a href="#main-content">Skip to main content</a>`) for keyboard users to jump past navigation. Hide off-screen, show on focus.

## Gesture Discoverability

Swipe-to-delete and similar gestures are invisible. Hint at their existence:

- **Partially reveal**: Show delete button peeking from edge
- **Onboarding**: Coach marks on first use
- **Alternative**: Always provide a visible fallback (menu with "Delete")

Don't rely on gestures as the only way to perform actions.

---

**Avoid**: Removing focus indicators without alternatives. Using placeholder text as labels. Touch targets <44x44px. Generic error messages. Custom controls without ARIA/keyboard support.

---

# Motion Design

## Duration: The 100/300/500 Rule

Timing matters more than easing. These durations feel right for most UI:

| Duration | Use Case | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **100-150ms** | Instant feedback | Button press, toggle, color change |
| **200-300ms** | State changes | Menu open, tooltip, hover states |
| **300-500ms** | Layout changes | Accordion, modal, drawer |
| **500-800ms** | Entrance animations | Page load, hero reveals |

**Exit animations are faster than entrances**—use ~75% of enter duration.

## Easing: Pick the Right Curve

**Don't use `ease`.** It's a compromise that's rarely optimal. Instead:

| Curve | Use For | CSS |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **ease-out** | Elements entering | `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` |
| **ease-in** | Elements leaving | `cubic-bezier(0.7, 0, 0.84, 0)` |
| **ease-in-out** | State toggles (there → back) | `cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1)` |

**For micro-interactions, use exponential curves**—they feel natural because they mimic real physics (friction, deceleration):

```css
/* Quart out - smooth, refined (recommended default) */
--ease-out-quart: cubic-bezier(0.25, 1, 0.5, 1);

/* Quint out - slightly more dramatic */
--ease-out-quint: cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1);

/* Expo out - snappy, confident */
--ease-out-expo: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
```

**Avoid bounce and elastic curves.** They were trendy in 2015 but now feel tacky and amateurish. Real objects don't bounce when they stop—they decelerate smoothly. Overshoot effects draw attention to the animation itself rather than the content.

## The Only Two Properties You Should Animate

**transform** and **opacity** only—everything else causes layout recalculation. For height animations (accordions), use `grid-template-rows: 0fr → 1fr` instead of animating `height` directly.

## Staggered Animations

Use CSS custom properties for cleaner stagger: `animation-delay: calc(var(--i, 0) * 50ms)` with `style="--i: 0"` on each item. **Cap total stagger time**—10 items at 50ms = 500ms total. For many items, reduce per-item delay or cap staggered count.

## Reduced Motion

This is not optional. Vestibular disorders affect ~35% of adults over 40.

```css
/* Define animations normally */
.card {
  animation: slide-up 500ms ease-out;
}

/* Provide alternative for reduced motion */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .card {
    animation: fade-in 200ms ease-out;  /* Crossfade instead of motion */
  }
}

/* Or disable entirely */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

**What to preserve**: Functional animations like progress bars, loading spinners (slowed down), and focus indicators should still work—just without spatial movement.

## Perceived Performance

**Nobody cares how fast your site is—just how fast it feels.** Perception can be as effective as actual performance.

**The 80ms threshold**: Our brains buffer sensory input for ~80ms to synchronize perception. Anything under 80ms feels instant and simultaneous. This is your target for micro-interactions.

**Active vs passive time**: Passive waiting (staring at a spinner) feels longer than active engagement. Strategies to shift the balance:

- **Preemptive start**: Begin transitions immediately while loading (iOS app zoom, skeleton UI). Users perceive work happening.
- **Early completion**: Show content progressively—don't wait for everything. Video buffering, progressive images, streaming HTML.
- **Optimistic UI**: Update the interface immediately, handle failures gracefully. Instagram likes work offline—the UI updates instantly, syncs later. Use for low-stakes actions; avoid for payments or destructive operations.

**Easing affects perceived duration**: Ease-in (accelerating toward completion) makes tasks feel shorter because the peak-end effect weights final moments heavily. Ease-out feels satisfying for entrances, but ease-in toward a task's end compresses perceived time.

**Caution**: Too-fast responses can decrease perceived value. Users may distrust instant results for complex operations (search, analysis). Sometimes a brief delay signals "real work" is happening.

## Performance

Don't use `will-change` preemptively—only when animation is imminent (`:hover`, `.animating`). For scroll-triggered animations, use Intersection Observer instead of scroll events; unobserve after animating once. Create motion tokens for consistency (durations, easings, common transitions).

---

**Avoid**: Animating everything (animation fatigue is real). Using >500ms for UI feedback. Ignoring `prefers-reduced-motion`. Using animation to hide slow loading.

---

# Responsive Design

## Mobile-First: Write It Right

Start with base styles for mobile, use `min-width` queries to layer complexity. Desktop-first (`max-width`) means mobile loads unnecessary styles first.

## Breakpoints: Content-Driven

Don't chase device sizes—let content tell you where to break. Start narrow, stretch until design breaks, add breakpoint there. Three breakpoints usually suffice (640, 768, 1024px). Use `clamp()` for fluid values without breakpoints.

## Detect Input Method, Not Just Screen Size

**Screen size doesn't tell you input method.** A laptop with touchscreen, a tablet with keyboard—use pointer and hover queries:

```css
/* Fine pointer (mouse, trackpad) */
@media (pointer: fine) {
  .button { padding: 8px 16px; }
}

/* Coarse pointer (touch, stylus) */
@media (pointer: coarse) {
  .button { padding: 12px 20px; }  /* Larger touch target */
}

/* Device supports hover */
@media (hover: hover) {
  .card:hover { transform: translateY(-2px); }
}

/* Device doesn't support hover (touch) */
@media (hover: none) {
  .card { /* No hover state - use active instead */ }
}
```

**Critical**: Don't rely on hover for functionality. Touch users can't hover.

## Safe Areas: Handle the Notch

Modern phones have notches, rounded corners, and home indicators. Use `env()`:

```css
body {
  padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top);
  padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);
  padding-left: env(safe-area-inset-left);
  padding-right: env(safe-area-inset-right);
}

/* With fallback */
.footer {
  padding-bottom: max(1rem, env(safe-area-inset-bottom));
}
```

**Enable viewport-fit** in your meta tag:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">
```

## Responsive Images: Get It Right

### srcset with Width Descriptors

```html
<img
  src="hero-800.jpg"
  srcset="
    hero-400.jpg 400w,
    hero-800.jpg 800w,
    hero-1200.jpg 1200w
  "
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw"
  alt="Hero image"
>
```

**How it works**:
- `srcset` lists available images with their actual widths (`w` descriptors)
- `sizes` tells the browser how wide the image will display
- Browser picks the best file based on viewport width AND device pixel ratio

### Picture Element for Art Direction

When you need different crops/compositions (not just resolutions):

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="wide.jpg">
  <source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="tall.jpg">
  <img src="fallback.jpg" alt="...">
</picture>
```

## Layout Adaptation Patterns

**Navigation**: Three stages—hamburger + drawer on mobile, horizontal compact on tablet, full with labels on desktop. **Tables**: Transform to cards on mobile using `display: block` and `data-label` attributes. **Progressive disclosure**: Use `<details>/<summary>` for content that can collapse on mobile.

## Testing: Don't Trust DevTools Alone

DevTools device emulation is useful for layout but misses:

- Actual touch interactions
- Real CPU/memory constraints
- Network latency patterns
- Font rendering differences
- Browser chrome/keyboard appearances

**Test on at least**: One real iPhone, one real Android, a tablet if relevant. Cheap Android phones reveal performance issues you'll never see on simulators.

---

**Avoid**: Desktop-first design. Device detection instead of feature detection. Separate mobile/desktop codebases. Ignoring tablet and landscape. Assuming all mobile devices are powerful.

# Spatial Design

## Spacing Systems

### Use 4pt Base, Not 8pt

8pt systems are too coarse—you'll frequently need 12px (between 8 and 16). Use 4pt for granularity: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96px.

### Name Tokens Semantically

Name by relationship (`--space-sm`, `--space-lg`), not value (`--spacing-8`). Use `gap` instead of margins for sibling spacing—it eliminates margin collapse and cleanup hacks.

## Grid Systems

### The Self-Adjusting Grid

Use `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr))` for responsive grids without breakpoints. Columns are at least 280px, as many as fit per row, leftovers stretch. For complex layouts, use named grid areas (`grid-template-areas`) and redefine them at breakpoints.

## Visual Hierarchy

### The Squint Test

Blur your eyes (or screenshot and blur). Can you still identify:
- The most important element?
- The second most important?
- Clear groupings?

If everything looks the same weight blurred, you have a hierarchy problem.

### Hierarchy Through Multiple Dimensions

Don't rely on size alone. Combine:

| Tool | Strong Hierarchy | Weak Hierarchy |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| **Size** | 3:1 ratio or more | <2:1 ratio |
| **Weight** | Bold vs Regular | Medium vs Regular |
| **Color** | High contrast | Similar tones |
| **Position** | Top/left (primary) | Bottom/right |
| **Space** | Surrounded by white space | Crowded |

**The best hierarchy uses 2-3 dimensions at once**: A heading that's larger, bolder, AND has more space above it.

### Cards Are Not Required

Cards are overused. Spacing and alignment create visual grouping naturally. Use cards only when content is truly distinct and actionable, items need visual comparison in a grid, or content needs clear interaction boundaries. **Never nest cards inside cards**—use spacing, typography, and subtle dividers for hierarchy within a card.

## Container Queries

Viewport queries are for page layouts. **Container queries are for components**:

```css
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

.card {
  display: grid;
  gap: var(--space-md);
}

/* Card layout changes based on its container, not viewport */
@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    grid-template-columns: 120px 1fr;
  }
}
```

**Why this matters**: A card in a narrow sidebar stays compact, while the same card in a main content area expands—automatically, without viewport hacks.

## Optical Adjustments

Text at `margin-left: 0` looks indented due to letterform whitespace—use negative margin (`-0.05em`) to optically align. Geometrically centered icons often look off-center; play icons need to shift right, arrows shift toward their direction.

### Touch Targets vs Visual Size

Buttons can look small but need large touch targets (44px minimum). Use padding or pseudo-elements:

```css
.icon-button {
  width: 24px;  /* Visual size */
  height: 24px;
  position: relative;
}

.icon-button::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  inset: -10px;  /* Expand tap target to 44px */
}
```

## Depth & Elevation

Create semantic z-index scales (dropdown → sticky → modal-backdrop → modal → toast → tooltip) instead of arbitrary numbers. For shadows, create a consistent elevation scale (sm → md → lg → xl). **Key insight**: Shadows should be subtle—if you can clearly see it, it's probably too strong.

---

**Avoid**: Arbitrary spacing values outside your scale. Making all spacing equal (variety creates hierarchy). Creating hierarchy through size alone - combine size, weight, color, and space.

---

# Typography

## Classic Typography Principles

### Vertical Rhythm

Your line-height should be the base unit for ALL vertical spacing. If body text has `line-height: 1.5` on `16px` type (= 24px), spacing values should be multiples of 24px. This creates subconscious harmony—text and space share a mathematical foundation.

### Modular Scale & Hierarchy

The common mistake: too many font sizes that are too close together (14px, 15px, 16px, 18px...). This creates muddy hierarchy.

**Use fewer sizes with more contrast.** A 5-size system covers most needs:

| Role | Typical Ratio | Use Case |
|------|---------------|----------|
| xs | 0.75rem | Captions, legal |
| sm | 0.875rem | Secondary UI, metadata |
| base | 1rem | Body text |
| lg | 1.25-1.5rem | Subheadings, lead text |
| xl+ | 2-4rem | Headlines, hero text |

Popular ratios: 1.25 (major third), 1.333 (perfect fourth), 1.5 (perfect fifth). Pick one and commit.

### Readability & Measure

Use `ch` units for character-based measure (`max-width: 65ch`). Line-height scales inversely with line length—narrow columns need tighter leading, wide columns need more.

**Non-obvious**: Increase line-height for light text on dark backgrounds. The perceived weight is lighter, so text needs more breathing room. Add 0.05-0.1 to your normal line-height.

## Font Selection & Pairing

### Choosing Distinctive Fonts

**Avoid the invisible defaults**: Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, Montserrat. These are everywhere, making your design feel generic. They're fine for documentation or tools where personality isn't the goal—but if you want distinctive design, look elsewhere.

**Better Google Fonts alternatives**:
- Instead of Inter → **Instrument Sans**, **Plus Jakarta Sans**, **Outfit**
- Instead of Roboto → **Onest**, **Figtree**, **Urbanist**
- Instead of Open Sans → **Source Sans 3**, **Nunito Sans**, **DM Sans**
- For editorial/premium feel → **Fraunces**, **Newsreader**, **Lora**

**System fonts are underrated**: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", system-ui` looks native, loads instantly, and is highly readable. Consider this for apps where performance > personality.

### Pairing Principles

**The non-obvious truth**: You often don't need a second font. One well-chosen font family in multiple weights creates cleaner hierarchy than two competing typefaces. Only add a second font when you need genuine contrast (e.g., display headlines + body serif).

When pairing, contrast on multiple axes:
- Serif + Sans (structure contrast)
- Geometric + Humanist (personality contrast)
- Condensed display + Wide body (proportion contrast)

**Never pair fonts that are similar but not identical** (e.g., two geometric sans-serifs). They create visual tension without clear hierarchy.

### Web Font Loading

The layout shift problem: fonts load late, text reflows, and users see content jump. Here's the fix:

```css
/* 1. Use font-display: swap for visibility */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'CustomFont';
  src: url('font.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-display: swap;
}

/* 2. Match fallback metrics to minimize shift */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'CustomFont-Fallback';
  src: local('Arial');
  size-adjust: 105%;        /* Scale to match x-height */
  ascent-override: 90%;     /* Match ascender height */
  descent-override: 20%;    /* Match descender depth */
  line-gap-override: 10%;   /* Match line spacing */
}

body {
  font-family: 'CustomFont', 'CustomFont-Fallback', sans-serif;
}
```

Tools like [Fontaine](https://github.com/unjs/fontaine) calculate these overrides automatically.

## Modern Web Typography

### Fluid Type

Fluid typography via `clamp(min, preferred, max)` scales text smoothly with the viewport. The middle value (e.g., `5vw + 1rem`) controls scaling rate—higher vw = faster scaling. Add a rem offset so it doesn't collapse to 0 on small screens.

**Use fluid type for**: Headings and display text on marketing/content pages where text dominates the layout and needs to breathe across viewport sizes.

**Use fixed `rem` scales for**: App UIs, dashboards, and data-dense interfaces. No major app design system (Material, Polaris, Primer, Carbon) uses fluid type in product UI — fixed scales with optional breakpoint adjustments give the spatial predictability that container-based layouts need. Body text should also be fixed even on marketing pages, since the size difference across viewports is too small to warrant it.

### OpenType Features

Most developers don't know these exist. Use them for polish:

```css
/* Tabular numbers for data alignment */
.data-table { font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; }

/* Proper fractions */
.recipe-amount { font-variant-numeric: diagonal-fractions; }

/* Small caps for abbreviations */
abbr { font-variant-caps: all-small-caps; }

/* Disable ligatures in code */
code { font-variant-ligatures: none; }

/* Enable kerning (usually on by default, but be explicit) */
body { font-kerning: normal; }
```

Check what features your font supports at [Wakamai Fondue](https://wakamaifondue.com/).

## Typography System Architecture

Name tokens semantically (`--text-body`, `--text-heading`), not by value (`--font-size-16`). Include font stacks, size scale, weights, line-heights, and letter-spacing in your token system.

## Accessibility Considerations

Beyond contrast ratios (which are well-documented), consider:

- **Never disable zoom**: `user-scalable=no` breaks accessibility. If your layout breaks at 200% zoom, fix the layout.
- **Use rem/em for font sizes**: This respects user browser settings. Never `px` for body text.
- **Minimum 16px body text**: Smaller than this strains eyes and fails WCAG on mobile.
- **Adequate touch targets**: Text links need padding or line-height that creates 44px+ tap targets.

---

**Avoid**: More than 2-3 font families per project. Skipping fallback font definitions. Ignoring font loading performance (FOUT/FOIT). Using decorative fonts for body text.

---

# UX Writing

## The Button Label Problem

**Never use "OK", "Submit", or "Yes/No".** These are lazy and ambiguous. Use specific verb + object patterns:

| Bad | Good | Why |
|-----|------|-----|
| OK | Save changes | Says what will happen |
| Submit | Create account | Outcome-focused |
| Yes | Delete message | Confirms the action |
| Cancel | Keep editing | Clarifies what "cancel" means |
| Click here | Download PDF | Describes the destination |

**For destructive actions**, name the destruction:
- "Delete" not "Remove" (delete is permanent, remove implies recoverable)
- "Delete 5 items" not "Delete selected" (show the count)

## Error Messages: The Formula

Every error message should answer: (1) What happened? (2) Why? (3) How to fix it? Example: "Email address isn't valid. Please include an @ symbol." not "Invalid input".

### Error Message Templates

| Situation | Template |
|-----------|----------|
| **Format error** | "[Field] needs to be [format]. Example: [example]" |
| **Missing required** | "Please enter [what's missing]" |
| **Permission denied** | "You don't have access to [thing]. [What to do instead]" |
| **Network error** | "We couldn't reach [thing]. Check your connection and [action]." |
| **Server error** | "Something went wrong on our end. We're looking into it. [Alternative action]" |

### Don't Blame the User

Reframe errors: "Please enter a date in MM/DD/YYYY format" not "You entered an invalid date".

## Empty States Are Opportunities

Empty states are onboarding moments: (1) Acknowledge briefly, (2) Explain the value of filling it, (3) Provide a clear action. "No projects yet. Create your first one to get started." not just "No items".

## Voice vs Tone

**Voice** is your brand's personality—consistent everywhere.
**Tone** adapts to the moment.

| Moment | Tone Shift |
|--------|------------|
| Success | Celebratory, brief: "Done! Your changes are live." |
| Error | Empathetic, helpful: "That didn't work. Here's what to try..." |
| Loading | Reassuring: "Saving your work..." |
| Destructive confirm | Serious, clear: "Delete this project? This can't be undone." |

**Never use humor for errors.** Users are already frustrated. Be helpful, not cute.

## Writing for Accessibility

**Link text** must have standalone meaning—"View pricing plans" not "Click here". **Alt text** describes information, not the image—"Revenue increased 40% in Q4" not "Chart". Use `alt=""` for decorative images. **Icon buttons** need `aria-label` for screen reader context.

## Writing for Translation

### Plan for Expansion

German text is ~30% longer than English. Allocate space:

| Language | Expansion |
|----------|-----------|
| German | +30% |
| French | +20% |
| Finnish | +30-40% |
| Chinese | -30% (fewer chars, but same width) |

### Translation-Friendly Patterns

Keep numbers separate ("New messages: 3" not "You have 3 new messages"). Use full sentences as single strings (word order varies by language). Avoid abbreviations ("5 minutes ago" not "5 mins ago"). Give translators context about where strings appear.

## Consistency: The Terminology Problem

Pick one term and stick with it:

| Inconsistent | Consistent |
|--------------|------------|
| Delete / Remove / Trash | Delete |
| Settings / Preferences / Options | Settings |
| Sign in / Log in / Enter | Sign in |
| Create / Add / New | Create |

Build a terminology glossary and enforce it. Variety creates confusion.

## Avoid Redundant Copy

If the heading explains it, the intro is redundant. If the button is clear, don't explain it again. Say it once, say it well.

## Loading States

Be specific: "Saving your draft..." not "Loading...". For long waits, set expectations ("This usually takes 30 seconds") or show progress.

## Confirmation Dialogs: Use Sparingly

Most confirmation dialogs are design failures—consider undo instead. When you must confirm: name the action, explain consequences, use specific button labels ("Delete project" / "Keep project", not "Yes" / "No").

## Form Instructions

Show format with placeholders, not instructions. For non-obvious fields, explain why you're asking.

---

**Avoid**: Jargon without explanation. Blaming users ("You made an error" → "This field is required"). Vague errors ("Something went wrong"). Varying terminology for variety. Humor for errors.

---

# Cognitive Load Assessment

Cognitive load is the total mental effort required to use an interface. Overloaded users make mistakes, get frustrated, and leave. This reference helps identify and fix cognitive overload.

---

## Three Types of Cognitive Load

### Intrinsic Load — The Task Itself
Complexity inherent to what the user is trying to do. You can't eliminate this, but you can structure it.

**Manage it by**:
- Breaking complex tasks into discrete steps
- Providing scaffolding (templates, defaults, examples)
- Progressive disclosure — show what's needed now, hide the rest
- Grouping related decisions together

### Extraneous Load — Bad Design
Mental effort caused by poor design choices. **Eliminate this ruthlessly** — it's pure waste.

**Common sources**:
- Confusing navigation that requires mental mapping
- Unclear labels that force users to guess meaning
- Visual clutter competing for attention
- Inconsistent patterns that prevent learning
- Unnecessary steps between user intent and result

### Germane Load — Learning Effort
Mental effort spent building understanding. This is *good* cognitive load — it leads to mastery.

**Support it by**:
- Progressive disclosure that reveals complexity gradually
- Consistent patterns that reward learning
- Feedback that confirms correct understanding
- Onboarding that teaches through action, not walls of text

---

## Cognitive Load Checklist

Evaluate the interface against these 8 items:

- [ ] **Single focus**: Can the user complete their primary task without distraction from competing elements?
- [ ] **Chunking**: Is information presented in digestible groups (≤4 items per group)?
- [ ] **Grouping**: Are related items visually grouped together (proximity, borders, shared background)?
- [ ] **Visual hierarchy**: Is it immediately clear what's most important on the screen?
- [ ] **One thing at a time**: Can the user focus on a single decision before moving to the next?
- [ ] **Minimal choices**: Are decisions simplified (≤4 visible options at any decision point)?
- [ ] **Working memory**: Does the user need to remember information from a previous screen to act on the current one?
- [ ] **Progressive disclosure**: Is complexity revealed only when the user needs it?

**Scoring**: Count the failed items. 0–1 failures = low cognitive load (good). 2–3 = moderate (address soon). 4+ = high cognitive load (critical fix needed).

---

## The Working Memory Rule

**Humans can hold ≤4 items in working memory at once** (Miller's Law revised by Cowan, 2001).

At any decision point, count the number of distinct options, actions, or pieces of information a user must simultaneously consider:
- **≤4 items**: Within working memory limits — manageable
- **5–7 items**: Pushing the boundary — consider grouping or progressive disclosure
- **8+ items**: Overloaded — users will skip, misclick, or abandon

**Practical applications**:
- Navigation menus: ≤5 top-level items (group the rest under clear categories)
- Form sections: ≤4 fields visible per group before a visual break
- Action buttons: 1 primary, 1–2 secondary, group the rest in a menu
- Dashboard widgets: ≤4 key metrics visible without scrolling
- Pricing tiers: ≤3 options (more causes analysis paralysis)

---

## Common Cognitive Load Violations

### 1. The Wall of Options
**Problem**: Presenting 10+ choices at once with no hierarchy.
**Fix**: Group into categories, highlight recommended, use progressive disclosure.

### 2. The Memory Bridge
**Problem**: User must remember info from step 1 to complete step 3.
**Fix**: Keep relevant context visible, or repeat it where it's needed.

### 3. The Hidden Navigation
**Problem**: User must build a mental map of where things are.
**Fix**: Always show current location (breadcrumbs, active states, progress indicators).

### 4. The Jargon Barrier
**Problem**: Technical or domain language forces translation effort.
**Fix**: Use plain language. If domain terms are unavoidable, define them inline.

### 5. The Visual Noise Floor
**Problem**: Every element has the same visual weight — nothing stands out.
**Fix**: Establish clear hierarchy: one primary element, 2–3 secondary, everything else muted.

### 6. The Inconsistent Pattern
**Problem**: Similar actions work differently in different places.
**Fix**: Standardize interaction patterns. Same type of action = same type of UI.

### 7. The Multi-Task Demand
**Problem**: Interface requires processing multiple simultaneous inputs (reading + deciding + navigating).
**Fix**: Sequence the steps. Let the user do one thing at a time.

### 8. The Context Switch
**Problem**: User must jump between screens/tabs/modals to gather info for a single decision.
**Fix**: Co-locate the information needed for each decision. Reduce back-and-forth.

# Heuristics Scoring Guide

Score each of Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics on a 0–4 scale. Be honest — a 4 means genuinely excellent, not "good enough."

## Nielsen's 10 Heuristics

### 1. Visibility of System Status

Keep users informed about what's happening through timely, appropriate feedback.

**Check for**:
- Loading indicators during async operations
- Confirmation of user actions (save, submit, delete)
- Progress indicators for multi-step processes
- Current location in navigation (breadcrumbs, active states)
- Form validation feedback (inline, not just on submit)

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | No feedback — user is guessing what happened |
| 1 | Rare feedback — most actions produce no visible response |
| 2 | Partial — some states communicated, major gaps remain |
| 3 | Good — most operations give clear feedback, minor gaps |
| 4 | Excellent — every action confirms, progress is always visible |

### 2. Match Between System and Real World

Speak the user's language. Follow real-world conventions. Information appears in natural, logical order.

**Check for**:
- Familiar terminology (no unexplained jargon)
- Logical information order matching user expectations
- Recognizable icons and metaphors
- Domain-appropriate language for the target audience
- Natural reading flow (left-to-right, top-to-bottom priority)

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Pure tech jargon, alien to users |
| 1 | Mostly confusing — requires domain expertise to navigate |
| 2 | Mixed — some plain language, some jargon leaks through |
| 3 | Mostly natural — occasional term needs context |
| 4 | Speaks the user's language fluently throughout |

### 3. User Control and Freedom

Users need a clear "emergency exit" from unwanted states without extended dialogue.

**Check for**:
- Undo/redo functionality
- Cancel buttons on forms and modals
- Clear navigation back to safety (home, previous)
- Easy way to clear filters, search, selections
- Escape from long or multi-step processes

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Users get trapped — no way out without refreshing |
| 1 | Difficult exits — must find obscure paths to escape |
| 2 | Some exits — main flows have escape, edge cases don't |
| 3 | Good control — users can exit and undo most actions |
| 4 | Full control — undo, cancel, back, and escape everywhere |

### 4. Consistency and Standards

Users shouldn't wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.

**Check for**:
- Consistent terminology throughout the interface
- Same actions produce same results everywhere
- Platform conventions followed (standard UI patterns)
- Visual consistency (colors, typography, spacing, components)
- Consistent interaction patterns (same gesture = same behavior)

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Inconsistent everywhere — feels like different products stitched together |
| 1 | Many inconsistencies — similar things look/behave differently |
| 2 | Partially consistent — main flows match, details diverge |
| 3 | Mostly consistent — occasional deviation, nothing confusing |
| 4 | Fully consistent — cohesive system, predictable behavior |

### 5. Error Prevention

Better than good error messages is a design that prevents problems in the first place.

**Check for**:
- Confirmation before destructive actions (delete, overwrite)
- Constraints preventing invalid input (date pickers, dropdowns)
- Smart defaults that reduce errors
- Clear labels that prevent misunderstanding
- Autosave and draft recovery

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Errors easy to make — no guardrails anywhere |
| 1 | Few safeguards — some inputs validated, most aren't |
| 2 | Partial prevention — common errors caught, edge cases slip |
| 3 | Good prevention — most error paths blocked proactively |
| 4 | Excellent — errors nearly impossible through smart constraints |

### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall

Minimize memory load. Make objects, actions, and options visible or easily retrievable.

**Check for**:
- Visible options (not buried in hidden menus)
- Contextual help when needed (tooltips, inline hints)
- Recent items and history
- Autocomplete and suggestions
- Labels on icons (not icon-only navigation)

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Heavy memorization — users must remember paths and commands |
| 1 | Mostly recall — many hidden features, few visible cues |
| 2 | Some aids — main actions visible, secondary features hidden |
| 3 | Good recognition — most things discoverable, few memory demands |
| 4 | Everything discoverable — users never need to memorize |

### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

Accelerators — invisible to novices — speed up expert interaction.

**Check for**:
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Customizable interface elements
- Recent items and favorites
- Bulk/batch actions
- Power user features that don't complicate the basics

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | One rigid path — no shortcuts or alternatives |
| 1 | Limited flexibility — few alternatives to the main path |
| 2 | Some shortcuts — basic keyboard support, limited bulk actions |
| 3 | Good accelerators — keyboard nav, some customization |
| 4 | Highly flexible — multiple paths, power features, customizable |

### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

Interfaces should not contain irrelevant or rarely needed information. Every element should serve a purpose.

**Check for**:
- Only necessary information visible at each step
- Clear visual hierarchy directing attention
- Purposeful use of color and emphasis
- No decorative clutter competing for attention
- Focused, uncluttered layouts

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Overwhelming — everything competes for attention equally |
| 1 | Cluttered — too much noise, hard to find what matters |
| 2 | Some clutter — main content clear, periphery noisy |
| 3 | Mostly clean — focused design, minor visual noise |
| 4 | Perfectly minimal — every element earns its pixel |

### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

Error messages should use plain language, precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

**Check for**:
- Plain language error messages (no error codes for users)
- Specific problem identification ("Email is missing @" not "Invalid input")
- Actionable recovery suggestions
- Errors displayed near the source of the problem
- Non-blocking error handling (don't wipe the form)

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Cryptic errors — codes, jargon, or no message at all |
| 1 | Vague errors — "Something went wrong" with no guidance |
| 2 | Clear but unhelpful — names the problem but not the fix |
| 3 | Clear with suggestions — identifies problem and offers next steps |
| 4 | Perfect recovery — pinpoints issue, suggests fix, preserves user work |

### 10. Help and Documentation

Even if the system is usable without docs, help should be easy to find, task-focused, and concise.

**Check for**:
- Searchable help or documentation
- Contextual help (tooltips, inline hints, guided tours)
- Task-focused organization (not feature-organized)
- Concise, scannable content
- Easy access without leaving current context

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | No help available anywhere |
| 1 | Help exists but hard to find or irrelevant |
| 2 | Basic help — FAQ or docs exist, not contextual |
| 3 | Good documentation — searchable, mostly task-focused |
| 4 | Excellent contextual help — right info at the right moment |

---

## Score Summary

**Total possible**: 40 points (10 heuristics × 4 max)

| Score Range | Rating | What It Means |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 36–40 | Excellent | Minor polish only — ship it |
| 28–35 | Good | Address weak areas, solid foundation |
| 20–27 | Acceptable | Significant improvements needed before users are happy |
| 12–19 | Poor | Major UX overhaul required — core experience broken |
| 0–11 | Critical | Redesign needed — unusable in current state |

---

## Issue Severity (P0–P3)

Tag each individual issue found during scoring with a priority level:

| Priority | Name | Description | Action |
|----------|------|-------------|--------|
| **P0** | Blocking | Prevents task completion entirely | Fix immediately — this is a showstopper |
| **P1** | Major | Causes significant difficulty or confusion | Fix before release |
| **P2** | Minor | Annoyance, but workaround exists | Fix in next pass |
| **P3** | Polish | Nice-to-fix, no real user impact | Fix if time permits |

**Tip**: If you're unsure between two levels, ask: "Would a user contact support about this?" If yes, it's at least P1.

# Persona-Based Design Testing

Test the interface through the eyes of 5 distinct user archetypes. Each persona exposes different failure modes that a single "design director" perspective would miss.

**How to use**: Select 2–3 personas most relevant to the interface being critiqued. Walk through the primary user action as each persona. Report specific red flags — not generic concerns.

---

## 1. Impatient Power User — "Alex"

**Profile**: Expert with similar products. Expects efficiency, hates hand-holding. Will find shortcuts or leave.

**Behaviors**:
- Skips all onboarding and instructions
- Looks for keyboard shortcuts immediately
- Tries to bulk-select, batch-edit, and automate
- Gets frustrated by required steps that feel unnecessary
- Abandons if anything feels slow or patronizing

**Test Questions**:
- Can Alex complete the core task in under 60 seconds?
- Are there keyboard shortcuts for common actions?
- Can onboarding be skipped entirely?
- Do modals have keyboard dismiss (Esc)?
- Is there a "power user" path (shortcuts, bulk actions)?

**Red Flags** (report these specifically):
- Forced tutorials or unskippable onboarding
- No keyboard navigation for primary actions
- Slow animations that can't be skipped
- One-item-at-a-time workflows where batch would be natural
- Redundant confirmation steps for low-risk actions

---

## 2. Confused First-Timer — "Jordan"

**Profile**: Never used this type of product. Needs guidance at every step. Will abandon rather than figure it out.

**Behaviors**:
- Reads all instructions carefully
- Hesitates before clicking anything unfamiliar
- Looks for help or support constantly
- Misunderstands jargon and abbreviations
- Takes the most literal interpretation of any label

**Test Questions**:
- Is the first action obviously clear within 5 seconds?
- Are all icons labeled with text?
- Is there contextual help at decision points?
- Does terminology assume prior knowledge?
- Is there a clear "back" or "undo" at every step?

**Red Flags** (report these specifically):
- Icon-only navigation with no labels
- Technical jargon without explanation
- No visible help option or guidance
- Ambiguous next steps after completing an action
- No confirmation that an action succeeded

---

## 3. Accessibility-Dependent User — "Sam"

**Profile**: Uses screen reader (VoiceOver/NVDA), keyboard-only navigation. May have low vision, motor impairment, or cognitive differences.

**Behaviors**:
- Tabs through the interface linearly
- Relies on ARIA labels and heading structure
- Cannot see hover states or visual-only indicators
- Needs adequate color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- May use browser zoom up to 200%

**Test Questions**:
- Can the entire primary flow be completed keyboard-only?
- Are all interactive elements focusable with visible focus indicators?
- Do images have meaningful alt text?
- Is color contrast WCAG AA compliant (4.5:1 for text)?
- Does the screen reader announce state changes (loading, success, errors)?

**Red Flags** (report these specifically):
- Click-only interactions with no keyboard alternative
- Missing or invisible focus indicators
- Meaning conveyed by color alone (red = error, green = success)
- Unlabeled form fields or buttons
- Time-limited actions without extension option
- Custom components that break screen reader flow

---

## 4. Deliberate Stress Tester — "Riley"

**Profile**: Methodical user who pushes interfaces beyond the happy path. Tests edge cases, tries unexpected inputs, and probes for gaps in the experience.

**Behaviors**:
- Tests edge cases intentionally (empty states, long strings, special characters)
- Submits forms with unexpected data (emoji, RTL text, very long values)
- Tries to break workflows by navigating backwards, refreshing mid-flow, or opening in multiple tabs
- Looks for inconsistencies between what the UI promises and what actually happens
- Documents problems methodically

**Test Questions**:
- What happens at the edges (0 items, 1000 items, very long text)?
- Do error states recover gracefully or leave the UI in a broken state?
- What happens on refresh mid-workflow? Is state preserved?
- Are there features that appear to work but produce broken results?
- How does the UI handle unexpected input (emoji, special chars, paste from Excel)?

**Red Flags** (report these specifically):
- Features that appear to work but silently fail or produce wrong results
- Error handling that exposes technical details or leaves UI in a broken state
- Empty states that show nothing useful ("No results" with no guidance)
- Workflows that lose user data on refresh or navigation
- Inconsistent behavior between similar interactions in different parts of the UI

## 5. Distracted Mobile User — "Casey"

**Profile**: Using phone one-handed on the go. Frequently interrupted. Possibly on a slow connection.

**Behaviors**:
- Uses thumb only — prefers bottom-of-screen actions
- Gets interrupted mid-flow and returns later
- Switches between apps frequently
- Has limited attention span and low patience
- Types as little as possible, prefers taps and selections

**Test Questions**:
- Are primary actions in the thumb zone (bottom half of screen)?
- Is state preserved if the user leaves and returns?
- Does it work on slow connections (3G)?
- Can forms leverage autocomplete and smart defaults?
- Are touch targets at least 44×44pt?

**Red Flags** (report these specifically):
- Important actions positioned at the top of the screen (unreachable by thumb)
- No state persistence — progress lost on tab switch or interruption
- Large text inputs required where selection would work
- Heavy assets loading on every page (no lazy loading)
- Tiny tap targets or targets too close together

## Selecting Personas

Choose personas based on the interface type:

| Interface Type | Primary Personas | Why |
|---------------|-----------------|-----|
| Landing page / marketing | Jordan, Riley, Casey | First impressions, trust, mobile |
| Dashboard / admin | Alex, Sam | Power users, accessibility |
| E-commerce / checkout | Casey, Riley, Jordan | Mobile, edge cases, clarity |
| Onboarding flow | Jordan, Casey | Confusion, interruption |
| Data-heavy / analytics | Alex, Sam | Efficiency, keyboard nav |
| Form-heavy / wizard | Jordan, Sam, Casey | Clarity, accessibility, mobile |

## Project-Specific Personas

If `AGENTS.md` contains a `## Design Context` section (generated by `teach-impeccable`), derive 1–2 additional personas from the audience and brand information:

1. Read the target audience description
2. Identify the primary user archetype not covered by the 5 predefined personas
3. Create a persona following this template:

```
### [Role] — "[Name]"

**Profile**: [2-3 key characteristics derived from Design Context]

**Behaviors**: [3-4 specific behaviors based on the described audience]

**Red Flags**: [3-4 things that would alienate this specific user type]
```

Only generate project-specific personas when real Design Context data is available. Don't invent audience details — use the 5 predefined personas when no context exists.
